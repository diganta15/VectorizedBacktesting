# VectorizedBacktesting

## Description

VectorizedBacktesting is a Python-based framework for implementing and testing trading strategies using vectorized operations. This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate various trading strategies including Simple Moving Average (SMA), Momentum, and Mean Reversion techniques.

## Features

- **Vectorized Implementation**: Fast and efficient backtesting using NumPy and Pandas operations
- **Multiple Strategy Examples**:
    - Simple Moving Average (SMA) trading strategies
    - Momentum-based trading approaches
    - Mean Reversion trading techniques
- **Jupyter Notebook Format**: Interactive examples with visualization and explanation


## Repository Contents

- `MeanReversion.ipynb`: Implementation and testing of mean reversion strategies
- `MomentumBacktesting.ipynb`: Momentum-based trading strategies backtesting
- `SMABacktesting.ipynb`: Simple Moving Average crossover strategy implementation
- `SMA_Application.ipynb`: Practical application of SMA strategies on market data
